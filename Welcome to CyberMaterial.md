The challenge Welcome To CyberMaterial required participants to discover a flag that was split into two halves. The initial step involved utilizing the Discord platform where the first half of the flag could be revealed.

### Step 1: Finding the First Half of the Flag
in the CyberMaterial Discord server for Hack Havoc 2.0, I used the command **/flag** in a text channel. The Carl bot will DM you with the first half of the flag.
