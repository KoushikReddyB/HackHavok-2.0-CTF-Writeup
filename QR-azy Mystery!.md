## Content
The **QR-azy Mystery!** challenge required working with a blurred QR code to uncover a hidden flag. To decode it, I first uploaded the image to an online sharpening tool, [PineTools](https://pinetools.com/sharpen-image), which enhanced the QR codeâ€™s clarity. Once sharpened, I was able to scan the QR code, revealing the flag and successfully completing the challenge.
