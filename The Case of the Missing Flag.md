The Case of the Missing Flag challenge involved uncovering a hidden flag within a disguised file. Hereâ€™s how I solved it:

### Step 1: Identifying the File Type
Using the command file abc.bat, I found that the file was actually an SVG image. I then renamed it to abc.svg to reflect the correct file type.

### Step 2: Aligning the QR Code
I opened the SVG file in Photoshop (or Photopea online) and adjusted the QR code by aligning its top corner box into a perfect square.

### Step 3: Scanning the QR Code
With the alignment corrected, the QR code became scannable, revealing the hidden flag.
