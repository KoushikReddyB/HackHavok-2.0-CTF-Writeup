## Content
The Hack Uncovered: OSNIT challenge required finding a hidden flag within a PDF packed with information on incidents and alerts for July 2024. Following the description’s hint, I focused on identifying references to “top threats,” “vulnerabilities,” and “regulations,” which pointed me toward the Hall of Hacks July 2024 monthly report section. Using OSINT skills, I carefully navigated this section to locate the hidden flag.
