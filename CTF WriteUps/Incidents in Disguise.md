## Content
The Stego: Incidents in Disguise challenge required uncovering a hidden flag using hints and steganography. The following steps outline my approach:

### Step 1: Following the Discord Hint
I began by following the Discord hint, "amos," which suggested that the hidden information could be accessed using the steghide tool. So i used grep tool to search for "amos" in entire wordlist
```bash
grep "amos" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Step 2: Manual Brute Force
Given the hint that the password would be found towards the end, I manually checked the last entry from my grep results and discovered that the correct password was "*7Â¡Vamos!"
